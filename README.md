## Overview

**The Britannicus Reading Room** is a staff-facing web application that lets a rare-book and antique-map dealership manage their entire operation from a single portal:

- Catalog every **item** (books, maps, periodicals) with rich metadata and provenance.
- Track **acquisitions** from dealers, collectors, and estates.
- Record **sales**, **customers**, and **payments**.
- Maintain an auditable **price history** for market-value tracking.
- Enforce fine-grained **role-based access** so that pricing, dealer contacts, and provenance are only visible to the right staff.

It was built as the capstone project for *Database Development II* by a team of six. The repository is structured as a **monorepo** containing a Next.js **frontend** (staff portal) and a Next.js **API backend** backed by **PostgreSQL** through **Prisma ORM**.

> Case study: Connor (owner), Luciia (manager), and Derek (employee) run a specialist shop dealing in rare books and antique maps. Each staff role sees a different slice of the system according to business rules.

---

## Highlights

- **Normalized relational schema** (20+ tables) modeling items, item subtypes (book / map / periodical), sources (dealer / collector / estate), sales, customers, addresses, provenance, and price history.
- **Full CRUD REST API** with consistent validation, error handling, and CORS-aware deployment split (frontend and backend on separate origins).
- **JWT authentication** stored in **HTTP-only, SameSite, `Secure`-in-production** cookies &mdash; no tokens in `localStorage`.
- **Two-layer authorization**: middleware gate for `/api/*` + per-handler `hasPermission(...)` checks mapped to business permissions such as `READ_PRICING`, `READ_PROVENANCE`, `READ_DEALER_CONTACT`, and `UPDATE_PRICING`.
- **Immutable audit logging** of privileged actions, viewable only by administrators.
- **Clean layered backend** &mdash; routes &rarr; services &rarr; repositories &rarr; Prisma &mdash; with a dedicated permissions library and a documented [API Authorization Matrix](./database_dev_2/backend/API_AUTHORIZATION_MATRIX.md).
- **Typed, responsive UI** built with the Next.js App Router, React 19, and Tailwind CSS; permission-aware rendering hides fields the current user is not allowed to see.
- **Automated guard verification** (`npm run verify:api-guards`) that statically checks every protected route has an auth + permission check before merging.
- **Seed script** provisions realistic demo data so the app is usable in under a minute after clone.

## System Architecture

```text

                  └──────────────────────┘
```

Requests flow through two enforcement points:

1. **Middleware** &mdash; rejects unauthenticated calls to any `/api/*` route (except the public `POST /api/auth/login` and `POST /api/auth/logout`).
2. **Route handler** &mdash; calls `getSessionUser(...)` and `hasPermission(user, PERMISSION)` before touching the database. Sensitive fields (e.g. cost, provenance, dealer email) are stripped server-side when the caller lacks the relevant permission.

## Data Model

High-level entities and how they relate:

```text
role ──< user ──< sales >── payment_method
                    │
customer ──< customer_address >── address
   │
   └──< sales >── item ──< price_history
                   ├──< provenance
                   ├─── book  ── author
                   ├─── book  ── publisher
                   ├─── map   ── cartographer
                   ├─── map   ── publisher
                   └─── periodical ── publisher

source ──┬── dealer
         ├── collector
         └── estate
             │
             └──< acquisition >── item
```

Key design choices:

- **Item subtyping**: `item` holds shared attributes (title, condition, cost, selling price, images). `book`, `map`, and `periodical` extend it 1-to-1 with type-specific fields (ISBN, binding, scale, issue date, etc.).
- **Source subtyping**: a single `source` can be refined as a `dealer`, `collector`, or `estate`, each with its own attributes (specialty, reliability rating, estate contact person, &hellip;).
- **Provenance chain**: every item can have multiple historical owners with verified/unverified status &mdash; critical for rare-books authenticity.
- **Price history**: market valuations are stored over time instead of overwriting a single price field, giving the shop a full audit trail.
- **Referential integrity**: `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on business records; `ON DELETE SET NULL` only where a related entity is optional (e.g. a map may outlive its cartographer record).

The full schema lives in [`database_dev_2/backend/prisma/schema.prisma`](./database_dev_2/backend/prisma/schema.prisma) and the initial migration at [`database_dev_2/backend/prisma/migrations/20260324231415_init/migration.sql`](./database_dev_2/backend/prisma/migrations/20260324231415_init/migration.sql).

---

## Security &amp; Access Control

The application ships with a documented **API Authorization Matrix** (see [`database_dev_2/backend/API_AUTHORIZATION_MATRIX.md`](./database_dev_2/backend/API_AUTHORIZATION_MATRIX.md)). Examples:

| Role       | Can browse catalog | Can edit pricing | Can see dealer contact | Can see provenance | Can view audit log |
|------------|:------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|
| Admin      |         ✓          |        ✓         |           ✓            |         ✓          |         ✓          |
| Manager    |         ✓          |        ✓         |           ✓            |         ✓          |         ✗          |
| Employee   |         ✓          |        ✗         |           ✗            |         ✗          |         ✗          |

Under the hood:

- Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt** before storage.
- Sessions are issued as signed **JWTs** and delivered as **HTTP-only** cookies with `SameSite=Lax` (and `Secure` in production).
- CORS is pinned to an allow-list of origins (`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`) so the API can be safely deployed on a different domain from the UI.
- Every privileged mutation writes an entry to the `audit_log` table (who, what, when, and a diff of relevant fields).
- A custom `npm run verify:api-guards` script walks every route in `src/app/api` and fails the build if a protected route forgets to call `hasPermission(...)`.

---

## Feature Walkthrough

- **Login / Logout** &mdash; `/login` with server-validated credentials, JWT cookie issued on success.
- **Dashboard** &mdash; landing page with quick links to the modules the current user has permission for.
- **Items** &mdash; list, search, view, create, edit, and delete inventory items (books, maps, periodicals) with images, condition, and optional provenance entries.
- **Customers** &mdash; contact records with one or more addresses, purchase history linked via sales.
- **Sources** &mdash; dealers, collectors, and estates that items are acquired from; dealer contacts hidden from employees by default.
- **Acquisitions** &mdash; record how and from whom each item entered inventory.
- **Sales** &mdash; record sales with customer, item, staff member, and payment method; server-side validates selling price against price history.
- **Price History** &mdash; append-only market-value log per item.
- **Users &amp; Roles** &mdash; admin-only user management UI.
- **Audit Logs** &mdash; admin-only, immutable activity feed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js **20+** and npm **10+**
- PostgreSQL (local or cloud)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd DatabaseDev2FinalProject/database_dev_2
npm install
npm --prefix frontend install
npm --prefix backend install
```

### 2. Configure environment

`backend/.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/DB_NAME?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET="replace-with-a-strong-secret"
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000"
```

`frontend/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:4000"
```

### 3. Set up the database

```bash
cd backend
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run prisma:seed
```

The seed script creates demo roles, users (admin / manager / employee), items, sources, acquisitions, and sales so you can explore the app immediately.

### 4. Run the app

From `database_dev_2/`:

```bash
npm run dev:backend     # API on http://localhost:4000
npm run dev:frontend    # UI  on http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Useful scripts

```bash
npm run build:backend
npm run build:frontend
npm run lint:backend
npm run lint:frontend

# Static check that every protected API route has an auth + permission guard
npm --prefix backend run verify:api-guards
```

- [ ] Customer-facing storefront with Stripe checkout
- [ ] Full-text search across titles, authors, and provenance notes
- [ ] Image upload to S3-compatible storage
- [ ] Automated end-to-end tests with Playwright
